# aotycount

A small script to count the common albums in the album of the year lists recorded in [@hubgit]'s https://aoty.hubmed.org/. The basic, and perhaps flawed, idea is that the more lists an album is on, the higher priority I should give to checking it out, to see what all the fuss is about.

(Thanks for the lists [@hubgit]!)
